# Connect Snake

An implementation of the game Snake inspired by the classic Connect Four game and [this gif](https://imgur.com/gallery/GBrEM)!

## Background

This is the sourcecode for snake game at [connect-snake.brahmlower.io](http://connect-snake.brahmlower.io). I'm primarily a backend developer, so my frontend code may be a little rough- feel free to open a pull request if you want to change anything :)

## Using the library

You can install connect-snake via npm:

```
npm install git+https://github.com/bplower/connect-snake.git
```

There's an example html file showing how to include the project in it's current state. It's quite messy, but I'm working on cleaning it up. **Proper usage and api docs coming soon to a markdown file near you!**

## Development

To get started, clone the repo, install the dependencies, build the project, then serve locally via:


### Storybook

You may need to set the following:

```shell
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

Then start storybook:

```
npm run storybook
```

```
make setup
make build
make serve
```

When building locally, everything is compiled to the `./public` folder, so any changes made to `example.html` or `example.js` will require the project to be rebuilt.
